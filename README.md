PHP/MySQL app to browse and maintain family frees.

Originally written in php4 days, I have finally restarted this project due growth in my own family in recent 6 years.
I also have a lot more space time.

# Roadmap

* To port it to php7 standard - ongoing
* Build a API to work with database
* Build a reactjs base frontend
* Build android app which consumed the API
